# Linux-commands-for-managing-file-permissions

### Scenario

I am a security professional in a large organization. I work primarily with my research team. Part of my job is to make sure the users on this team have the proper permissions. This helps to keep the system secure. 

My task is to examine the existing permissions on the file system. I will have to determine if they match the authorization that should be granted. If they do not match, I will need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.
